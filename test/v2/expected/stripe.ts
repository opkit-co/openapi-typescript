   * NotificationEvent

   * object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded`
   * event; and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an
   * `invoice.payment_failed` event. Note that many API requests may cause multiple
   * events to be created. For example, if you create a new subscription for a
   * customer, you will receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a
   * `charge.succeeded` event.
   *
   * Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The state of that
   * resource at the time of the change is embedded in the event's data field. For
   * example, a `charge.succeeded` event will contain a charge, and an
   * `invoice.payment_failed` event will contain an invoice.
   *
   * As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an
   * [individual event](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](https://stripe.com/docs/api#list_events)
   * from the API. We also have a separate
   * [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the
   * `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. Webhooks are managed
   * in your
   * [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks'),
   * and our [Using Webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) guide will help you get set up.
   *
   * When using [Connect](https://stripe.com/docs/connect), you can also receive notifications of
   * events that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there will be an
   * additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.
   *

   * guaranteed only for 30 days.

   * that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).
   *
   * If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,
   * Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note
   * that finalizing the invoice,
   * [when automatic](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/workflow/#auto_advance), does
   * not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits
   * until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last
   * webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have
   * connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after
   * creation to finalize the invoice.
   *
   * If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your
   * [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic'),
   * Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These
   * emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.
   *
   * Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the
   * amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually
   * charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's [minimum allowed charge
   * per currency](/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the
   * invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the
   * customer's running account balance which is applied to the next invoice.
   *
   * More details on the customer's account balance are
   * [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/object#customer_object-account_balance).

   * SetupIntent
   * @description A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's payment credentials for future payments.
   * For example, you could use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.
   * Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.
   *
   * Create a SetupIntent as soon as you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
   * Do not maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents as they may no longer be valid.
   * The SetupIntent then transitions through multiple [statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
   * you through the setup process.
   *
   * Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
   * For example, cardholders in [certain regions](/guides/strong-customer-authentication) may need to be run through
   * [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) at the time of payment method collection
   * in order to streamline later [off-session payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/setup-intents).
   * If the SetupIntent is used with a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer), upon success,
   * it will automatically attach the resulting payment method to that Customer.
   * We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
   * PaymentIntents to save payment methods in order to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.
   *
   * By using SetupIntents, you ensure that your customers experience the minimum set of required friction,
   * even as regulations change over time.

   * client-side. This ensures that no sensitive card data touches your server,
   * and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.

   * If you cannot use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using
   * the API with either your publishable or secret API key. Keep in mind that if
   * your integration uses this method, you are responsible for any PCI compliance
   * that may be required, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with
   * client-side tokenization, your customer's information is not sent directly to
   * Stripe, so we cannot determine how it is handled or stored.
   *
   * Tokens cannot be stored or used more than once. To store card or bank account
   * information for later use, you can create [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#customers)
   * objects or [Custom accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/api#external_accounts). Note that
